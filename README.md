Before we start working on any Azure Data Engineering project it is extremely important to adhere to an Azure Data Engineering Project Plan. 

An Azure Data Engineering Project Plan is a document that outlines the objectives, scope, deliverables, timeline, and resources of a data engineering project on the Azure platform. It helps to define the roles and responsibilities of the data engineers, data analysts, and other stakeholders involved in the project. It also helps to track the progress and quality of the project.
A typical Azure Data Engineering Project Plan consists of the following sections:
•	Project Overview: This section provides a brief introduction to the project, its background, purpose, goals, and expected outcomes. It also describes the business problem or opportunity that the project aims to address, and the value proposition for the organization.
•	Data Sources and Requirements: This section identifies and describes the data sources that will be used in the project, such as APIs, CSV files, databases, etc. It also specifies the data quality, availability, format, and volume of each data source. It also defines the data requirements for the project, such as the data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analysis needs.
•	Solution Architecture: This section presents the high-level design of the data engineering solution on the Azure platform. It shows how the data sources will be ingested, processed, stored, and analyzed using various Azure services and tools. It also explains the rationale behind choosing each service or tool, and how they will interact with each other. It may include diagrams or charts to illustrate the solution architecture.
•	Data Engineering Tasks: This section lists and describes the main tasks that need to be performed by the data engineers in each stage of the data engineering pipeline. It also assigns priorities, dependencies, and estimated efforts for each task. It may use a Gantt chart or a Kanban board to visualize the task breakdown and schedule.
•	Data Analysis and Visualization: This section describes how the data will be analyzed and visualized using tools such as Databricks and Power BI. It also defines the key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that will be used to measure the success of the project. It may include mock-ups or prototypes of the dashboards or reports that will be created.
•	Testing and Validation: This section outlines how the data engineering solution will be tested and validated for accuracy, completeness, reliability, and performance. It also defines the acceptance criteria and quality standards for each deliverable. It may include test cases or scenarios that will be used to verify the results.
•	Risk Management: This section identifies and assesses the potential risks that may affect the project, such as technical issues, data quality issues, security breaches, etc. It also proposes mitigation strategies and contingency plans for each risk. It may use a risk matrix or a risk register to document and prioritize the risks.
•	Communication Plan: This section describes how the communication among the project team members and other stakeholders will be managed throughout the project lifecycle. It also specifies the frequency, mode, format, and content of the communication. It may use a communication matrix or a stakeholder map to identify and classify the communication needs.
